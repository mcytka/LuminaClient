## System Requirements

To run Lumina Client, your device must meet the following specifications:

- **Android**: Android 9.0 (Pie) or later, supporting both 64-bit and 32-bit architectures.
- **Minecraft Version**: Minecraft Bedrock Edition 1.21.80 or later is recommended for optimal performance and compatibility.
- **Non-Android Platforms**: For PC, Mac, or other devices, Lumina operates remotely through an Android device running the client.
- **Storage**: At least 200 MB of free storage for the APK and associated data.
- **Internet**: A stable internet connection is recommended, especially for multiplayer servers.

No additional hardware is required, but enabling developer options on Android may improve the installation process.

---

## Installation Instructions

Setting up Lumina Client is quick and straightforward. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the APK**: Head to our [Releases page](https://github.com/TheProjectLumina/LuminaClient/releases) and download the latest Lumina Client APK.
2. **Allow Unknown Sources**: On your Android device, go to **Settings > Security** (or **Apps & Notifications** on newer versions) and enable **Install from Unknown Sources**.
3. **Install the APK**: Open the downloaded APK file using a file manager, tap to install, and follow the prompts.
4. **Launch Lumina**: Find Lumina in your app drawer, open it, and log in with your Minecraft account.
5. **Configure Settings**: Adjust keybinds, enable desired tools, and customize the UI to suit your preferences.
6. **Test on a Server**: Join a test server to ensure everything works as expected. For best results, start with a non-protected server to familiarize yourself with the features.

If you encounter issues, visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/78bqDpAHmK) for support or consult the [NOTICE](https://github.com/TheProjectLumina/LuminaClient/blob/main/NOTICE) file.

## Development Setup

For developers looking to contribute or customize Lumina, here’s how to set up your environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheProjectLumina/LuminaClient.git
    ```

   This downloads the full source code to your local machine.

2. **Open in Android Studio**:

   - Launch Android Studio and select **Open an existing project**.
   - Choose the `LuminaClient` directory and open it.

3. **Replace `google-services.json`**:

   - The repository includes a dummy `google-services.json` file, which must be replaced with your own for the app to build successfully.
   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Add an Android app to your Firebase project, following the prompts to download your `google-services.json` file.
   - Place the downloaded `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory of the LuminaClient project, overwriting the dummy file.
   - Ensure the package name in Firebase matches the one in `build.gradle` (e.g., `com.projectlumina.luminaclient`).

4. **Replace Amplitude API Key**:

   - Open `TrackUtil.kt` located in `com.project.lumina.client.essentials`.
   - Replace the placeholder or dummy Amplitude API key with your actual key.
   - You can obtain an API key by creating a project at [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/).
   - This is required for analytics and event tracking to function properly.

5. **Sync Gradle**:

   - Click **Sync Project with Gradle Files** to fetch dependencies.
   - Ensure you have the Android SDK (API level 28 or higher) and Gradle installed.

6. **Build and Test**:

   - Connect an Android device or configure an emulator.
   - Select **Run > Run 'app'** to build and deploy Lumina.
   - Test changes on a local Minecraft Bedrock server to verify functionality.
